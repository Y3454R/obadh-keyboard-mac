# Obadh Keyboard for MacOS
Obadh Keyboard is a modern, high-performance Bengali (Bangla) phonetic input method for macOS, powered by the [Obadh Engine](https://github.com/nsssayom/obadh_engine) â€” a linguistically accurate Roman-to-Bangla transliteration engine written in Rust.<br>
Modifications of obadh engine for Swift integration can be found [here](https://github.com/Y3454R/obadh_engine)
